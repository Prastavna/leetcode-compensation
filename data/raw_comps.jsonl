{"id": 7477684, "title": "Amazon || SDE - 2 || 3 YOE || Accepted offer", "content": "Hello folks, have recently interviewed at amazon and got an offer. Previous interview experiences were really key in cracking these rounds. Hence doing my bit by sharing my experience. \n\nI have a total of 3 yrs of experience of working at quick commerce startups (swiggy and zepto)\n\nFirst round: DM\u2019ed a recruiter looking for openings, soon within 3 days she shared a hacker rank link. This contained 2 DSA questions (both medium). First question was a binary search based and another on trees. Post that there were some LP based questions (choice based questions).\n\nIt took my recruiter almost 2 weeks to get back and another 10 days to schedule an interview. \n\nSecond Round: This was a System design round, the objective was to design an auction platform. Interviewer focussed primarily on DB schemas, scaling and designing low latency apis (caching). No LP was asked instead the interviewer asked to explain any interesting project from my past work.\n\nFollow ups: \n1. How do you handle edits to bids ( I suggesting allowing multiple bids rather than providing an edit option.) \n2. How would you support a near real-time leaderboard (redis sorted sets)\n3. How would you identify/track the winning bid (can\u2019t rely on redis as source of truth)\n\nI relied on hello interview for my prep, although I hadn\u2019t previously solved this question I was able to come up with an acceptable solution in time.\n\nVerdict: Passed, got good feedback from the interviewer.\n\nThird round: LLD discussion with Hiring manager, although this was supposed to be a LLD round, the interviewer primarily focused on my work ex at zepto and my design choices from my projects. We also discussed if we could build an inventory service using NoSQL (zepto uses SQL). Last 10 mins were focused on explaining what design pattern was used in some of my old projects. No LPs asked in this round.\n\nVerdict: Got positive feedback. I was worried cuz interviewer never asked any LLD question.\n\nRound 3: DSA round, a younger SDE-2 was the interviewer. First question - Implement an interface to navigate browser history. \nSecond question - Implement basic arithmetic operations  like +,-,*,/ without using any inbuilt functions.\n\nI used golang to write the code, and was able to implement both of these in time. Although the interviewer wasn\u2019t aware of this language and I had to explain the basics to him. Also I felt the interviewer was neither interested in understanding a diff language nor was able to ask follow ups properly \n\nVerdict: Positive but slightly hesitant.\n\nBar raiser: Was asked questions based on LPs related to ownership. 2 DSA questions, 1) rotten oranges (graph BFS) 2) Asteriod collisions (Stack)\n\nHeard back from the recruiter in two days, got an offer.\n\nOffer - 46L base, 29L joining bonus (over 2 years) and 38L esops\n", "vote_count": 65, "comment_count": 13, "view_count": 5141, "creation_date": "2026-01-08 10:47:14"}

Then went ahead with drawing a simple system with Load Balancer, Services and using DB to track requests. I had follow up questions on handling failures and DB being down. I had explained and communicated this can be scaled up to using API Gateway with Redis for a distributed system. Overall it went well and interviewer seemed happy.\n\nI later saw that there are various algos as well for implementing the request tracker. As I understand, it might depend on how we drive. It's good to be aware of the basic system asked & if we talk more, they ask more :)\n\n### R2: Behavioral : \nStandard resume and situational based questions. Be confident and relate answers to the questions asked and keep it crisp.\n\n### R3: Code review + DSA : \nBe thorough with Java Basics to highlight and suggest the fixes.

We had to write and explain our pseudocode to the panelist in 30 minutes, with 5 minutes for cross-questions on its time and space complexity and approach.\r\n\r\nRound 3 \u2192 Technical Round 2 (LLD):\r\nI was asked a LLD question similar to standard LeetCode design questions (Example: https://leetcode.com/problems/simple-bank-system/description/ ) where the function names and parameters are given and you have to fill in their working. The question was on ride sharing, with functions like add rides, find ride, book ride, cancel ride, etc. We had 1 hour to code it and run one test case. If you ran the test case successfully, you would have passed. After this, for 30 minutes, I was asked about the basics of OOPs, SOLID principles, and OS concepts like mutex and race conditions.\r\n\r\nRound 4 \u2192 Hiring Manager Round:\r\nI had a panelist with around 10+ years of experience. Here, I was grilled on my resume projects and on every little keyword. He wanted to know why I used a particular approach and asked me to come up with a better approach, along with why I used a specific tech stack and whether it was feasible in a real-life scenario. Along with this, I was asked standard HR questions.\r\n\r\nResult: Rejected\r\n\r\nEven though I feel that I did pretty well in all my rounds, since they only took one candidate for my role in SDE, I think I was rejected due to my HM round performance. Overall, it was a good learning experience for my next interviews with other big companies.", "vote_count": 3, "comment_count": 1, "view_count": 527, "creation_date": "2025-12-19 17:09:25"}

I proposed LCA approach where I would first find LCA of both nodes and then simple dfs would have worked with slight modification for path printing. \r\n\r\n2.

However I gave the answers which I had prepared. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# **Result:**\r\nI was not sure of the outcome as my third round did not look good to me.

Connected components of graph\r\n2. Bit Manipulation \r\n3. DP problem\r\n### Online Assessment 2\r\nThis was unique round compared to that of typical coding rounds, had one coding question and then system design round for 45 min.\r\n1. Dynamic Programming question - weighted job scheduling which is classic DP problem with Binary Search.\r\n2. System Design round -\r\nTo give you context I was asked to design the backend system for a threading feature inside a chat app like Slack or Microsoft Teams that lets users reply directly to a specific message in a channel without cluttering the main chat feed.\r\nBased on this problem statements 3 questions were asked which include designing non-functional features, Data model and relationships and then APIs and it's core functionality. These more or less covers the entire system design part.\r\n### Technical round\r\n1. This round was entirely based on the Online Assessment 2 round held for 70-80 min roughly.\r\nFirstly, on the DSA question which was asked they start by asking why did you choose this approach, is there any other alternative and how did you draw to a conclusion that only this works.\r\nIn short, you need to present your thinking ability and insights and present with some of test cases.\r\nAlso, share your thoughts about the Edge cases. \r\n2. On system design part, first I was asked to explain about the flow of building this feature and then questions on non-functional design features and their importance. Also I was asked to draw the ER model of the entire data bases which are gonna be used in building this feature. Asked to optimize the some of key features in the implementation part as well and was asked to write the code for API calls.\r\n\r\n##### I was rejected after this round.\r\n##### My learnings (what I feel went wrong) -\r\n1. Coming to DSA, it went good I explained my approach from bruteforce to optimization using DP very well.\r\n2. System Design is what I feel lacked, Asked about methods for durability of the data bases I explained about replicas, Write-Ahead logs and Backups but asked on more alternatives I stuck there. And also while designing ER model I feel that I was bit under-confident, and was asked to write API calls, I called two attributes where it can be done with calling one itself.\r\nThese are the parts where I missed and answered remaining all of them but learnings are always know all the alternative methods as well and be confident on what you're designing along with valid explanations.\r\n\r\nThough I didn't make it but I had idea of next rounds.\r\n\r\n### Mangerial Round\r\nComplete resume grill and can expect any type of questions. Be prepared!\r\n\r\n### HR round\r\nHR questions and assessing your work style and culture fit.\r\n\r\nAll the very best!! Let's crack it.
