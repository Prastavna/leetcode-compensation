{"id": 7548356, "title": "Uber | System Design Round | L5 | Design Kafka", "content": "Recently went through a system design round at Uber where the prompt was: \"Design a distributed message broker similar to Apache Kafka.\" The requirements focused on topic-based pub/sub, partitioned ordered storage, durability, consumer groups with parallel consumption, and at-least-once delivery. I thought the discussion went really well\u2014covered a ton of depth, including real Kafka internals and evolutions\u2014but ended up with some frustrating feedback.\n\n1. Requirements Clarification\nFunctional: Topics, publish/subscribe, ordered messages per partition, consumer groups for parallel processing, at-least-once guarantees via consumer acks.\nNon-functional: High throughput/low latency, durability (persistence to disk), scalability, fault tolerance.\nProbed on push vs. pull model \u2192 settled on pull-based (consumer polls) for better consumer pacing and backpressure handling.\n\n2. High-Level Architecture\nCore Components:\nBrokers clustered for scalability.\nTopics \u2192 Partitions \u2192 Replicas (primary + secondaries for fault tolerance).\nProducers publish to topics (key-based partitioning for ordering).\nConsumers in groups, with one-to-many consumer-to-partition mapping for parallelism.\nCoordination: Initially Zookeeper for metadata, leader election, and consumer offsets\u2014but explicitly discussed evolution to KRaft (quorum-based controller, no external dependency) as a more modern, ops-friendly direction.\nOptional Frontend Layer: Introduced a lightweight proxy layer for \"dumb\" clients (handles routing, auth, rate-limiting). Smart clients bypass it and talk directly to brokers after fetching metadata.\n\n3. Deep Dives & Trade-offs\nThis is where I went deep:\nStorage & Durability:\nWrite-ahead log style: Messages appended to partition segments on disk.\nPage cache leverage for fast reads.\nIn-sync replicas (ISR) concept: Leader waits for ack from ISR before committing.\nReplication & Failure Handling:\nPrimary host per partition, secondaries for redundancy.\nMix of sync (for durability) and async (for latency) replication.\nLeader election via ZAB (Zookeeper Atomic Broadcast) for strong consistency and quorum handling during network partitions or broker failures.\nProducer Side:\nSerialized operations at partition level for ordering.\nKey-based partitioning.\nConsumer Side:\nPoll + explicit ack for at-least-once guarantees.\nOffset tracking per consumer group/partition.\nParallel consumption within groups.\nRebalancing & Assignment:\nPartition assignment: Round-robin or resource-aware, ensuring replicas not co-located.\nCoordination: Used a flag (e.g., in Redis or metadata store) to pause consumers during rebalance\u2014simple and safe to avoid message loss/duplication. Discussed how this evolves toward Zookeeper based rebalancing in mature systems.\nScalability Topics:\nAdding/removing brokers: Reassign partitions via controller.\n\n\n4. Other Advanced Points\nExplicitly highlighted Kafka's real evolution: From heavy Zookeeper dependency \u2192 KRaft for self-managed quorum\n\n\n**Overall, I felt that the interview went quite well and was expecting Hire at least from the round. Considering other rounds were also postivie only I felt that I had more than 50% chance of being selected. However, to my horror I was told that I might only be eligible for L4 as there were callouts in relation to not asking enough calrifying questions. Since LLD, DSA and Managerial rounds went well and this problem itself was not very vague I can't seem to figure out what went wrong. My guess is that there are too many candidates so they end up finding weird reasons to reject candidates. To top it all, they rescheduled my interviews like 5-6 times and I had to keep on brushing up my concepts**\n\n![Screenshot 2026-01-23 at 3.33.29\u202fPM.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/d1917ecb-7e88-4c2d-a5e0-40f80cc792d2_1770114702.9370987.png)\n\n\n\n", "vote_count": 15, "comment_count": 8, "view_count": 2575, "creation_date": "2026-02-03 10:33:42"}

Previous interview experiences were really key in cracking these rounds. Hence doing my bit by sharing my experience. \n\nI have a total of 3 yrs of experience of working at quick commerce startups (swiggy and zepto)\n\nFirst round: DM\u2019ed a recruiter looking for openings, soon within 3 days she shared a hacker rank link. This contained 2 DSA questions (both medium). First question was a binary search based and another on trees. Post that there were some LP based questions (choice based questions).\n\nIt took my recruiter almost 2 weeks to get back and another 10 days to schedule an interview. \n\nSecond Round: This was a System design round, the objective was to design an auction platform. Interviewer focussed primarily on DB schemas, scaling and designing low latency apis (caching). No LP was asked instead the interviewer asked to explain any interesting project from my past work.\n\nFollow ups: \n1. How do you handle edits to bids ( I suggesting allowing multiple bids rather than providing an edit option.) \n2. How would you support a near real-time leaderboard (redis sorted sets)\n3. How would you identify/track the winning bid (can\u2019t rely on redis as source of truth)\n\nI relied on hello interview for my prep, although I hadn\u2019t previously solved this question I was able to come up with an acceptable solution in time.\n\nVerdict: Passed, got good feedback from the interviewer.\n\nThird round: LLD discussion with Hiring manager, although this was supposed to be a LLD round, the interviewer primarily focused on my work ex at zepto and my design choices from my projects. We also discussed if we could build an inventory service using NoSQL (zepto uses SQL). Last 10 mins were focused on explaining what design pattern was used in some of my old projects. No LPs asked in this round.\n\nVerdict: Got positive feedback. I was worried cuz interviewer never asked any LLD question.\n\nRound 3: DSA round, a younger SDE-2 was the interviewer. First question - Implement an interface to navigate browser history. \nSecond question - Implement basic arithmetic operations  like +,-,*,/ without using any inbuilt functions.\n\nI used golang to write the code, and was able to implement both of these in time. Although the interviewer wasn\u2019t aware of this language and I had to explain the basics to him. Also I felt the interviewer was neither interested in understanding a diff language nor was able to ask follow ups properly \n\nVerdict: Positive but slightly hesitant.\n\nBar raiser: Was asked questions based on LPs related to ownership. 2 DSA questions, 1) rotten oranges (graph BFS) 2) Asteriod collisions (Stack)\n\nHeard back from the recruiter in two days, got an offer.\n\nOffer - 46L base, 29L joining bonus (over 2 years) and 38L esops\n", "vote_count": 65, "comment_count": 13, "view_count": 5141, "creation_date": "2026-01-08 10:47:14"}

There were 2 questions at the level of easy-medium.\n\nFun part comes here as I had almost forgotten that I have given OA as they reached out to me at the end of October for scheduling the interview loop. Leetcode Discuss section helped me understand the interview pattern and prepare for it in short time.\n\nThe interview happened as a drive with many candidates joining in a zoom call and sent to different rooms. There were 3 rounds which can happen in any order.\n\n### R1: System Design - HLD\nThey have hackerrank whiteboard set up with structure for interview and asked me to design a Rate Limiter. I have not did this question before but with the understanding I had asked for Functional & Non-functional requirements and defined the APIs and Entities. Then went ahead with drawing a simple system with Load Balancer, Services and using DB to track requests. I had follow up questions on handling failures and DB being down. I had explained and communicated this can be scaled up to using API Gateway with Redis for a distributed system. Overall it went well and interviewer seemed happy.\n\nI later saw that there are various algos as well for implementing the request tracker. As I understand, it might depend on how we drive. It's good to be aware of the basic system asked & if we talk more, they ask more :)\n\n### R2: Behavioral : \nStandard resume and situational based questions. Be confident and relate answers to the questions asked and keep it crisp.\n\n### R3: Code review + DSA : \nBe thorough with Java Basics to highlight and suggest the fixes. One DSA question on the easy-medium, take time to understand and ask clarifying questions. Can solve easily if don't panic.\n\nI used Hello Interview to recap DSA and learn System Design\n\n\n# Compenstation Details:\n\nCurrent Company : MNC Bank\nCurrent CTC : 16 LPA\nLocation : Bangalore\nYOE : 3 years 4 months (when interviewed)\nEducation : B.Tech from NIT\n\nJPMC Offer\nLocation : Hyderabad\nPosition : SDE2 (Associate)\nFixed : 25 LPA (including PF)\nVariable : 0-12% (Not mentioned in Offer Letter)\nRelocation : Standard JPMC Relocation benefits\n\nAccpted the offer, couldn't negotiate much as HR said can't go for more and I didn't get any competing offers.", "vote_count": 2, "comment_count": 6, "view_count": 1724, "creation_date": "2026-01-01 13:46:36"}

I was serving notice period at the Investment Bank, and was about to join the Core Bank.\r\n\r\n**Round 1**\r\nThere were 2 hard but standard questions on graphs.\r\n\r\n[Alien Dictionary](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/)\r\n[Word Ladder II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder-ii/description/)\r\n\r\nIt went smooth, interviewer was friendly. Got a call from the recruiter to schedule next round the next day.\r\n\r\n**Round 2**\r\nIt was a problem solving and debugging round. I had to clone an open source database driver codebase from GitHub. Then, the interviewer asked me to explain where different features are implemented in the code - the code block or the line. He started with specific database configurations like pools, connection logic.\r\n\r\nThen I had to clone the database codebase itself. The interviewer asked where indexing is implemented. Then I had to show where the actual execution logic was implemented. \r\n\r\nI was appearing for such type of round for the first time. I had prior open-source experience, so that helped.\r\n\r\nFew days later, I got a call from the recruiter that they have chosen someone internally.\r\n\r\n(I got another call after 2 weeks that there is one more opening, and I was the foremost in interview queue so they wanted to schedule next rounds. But I had joined the core bank by then. Still I appeared for the interview.)\r\n\r\n**Round 3**\r\nIt was an HLD round. The interviewer was friendly and asked to design a Chat Application. I presented my approach, we discussed on the tradeoffs and it went well.\r\n\r\nGot a call the same day to schedule next round.\r\n\r\n**Round 4**\r\nIt was HM round. He asked some technical questions around Kafka and messaging systems. Then there was some discussion around the job role and day-to-day activities. We discussed on my open source experience, and my interests in core technologies. It was perhaps my favourite round.\r\n\r\nGot final result after a few days.\r\n\r\nResult - **Selected**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "vote_count": 18, "comment_count": 6, "view_count": 1800, "creation_date": "2025-12-21 18:12:14"}

One was a simple array-based LeetCode Easy, one was based on graphs along the lines of finding the best route a salesman can take to minimize operations, and one was based on backtracking using dynamic programming and can be called as a LeetCode Hard.\r\n\r\nRound 2 \u2192 Technical Round 1 (DSA):\r\nI was asked an easy-to-medium scheduling question that could have been solved using arrays or using heaps and hash maps for an optimal solution. We had to write and explain our pseudocode to the panelist in 30 minutes, with 5 minutes for cross-questions on its time and space complexity and approach.\r\n\r\nRound 3 \u2192 Technical Round 2 (LLD):\r\nI was asked a LLD question similar to standard LeetCode design questions (Example: https://leetcode.com/problems/simple-bank-system/description/ ) where the function names and parameters are given and you have to fill in their working. The question was on ride sharing, with functions like add rides, find ride, book ride, cancel ride, etc. We had 1 hour to code it and run one test case. If you ran the test case successfully, you would have passed. After this, for 30 minutes, I was asked about the basics of OOPs, SOLID principles, and OS concepts like mutex and race conditions.\r\n\r\nRound 4 \u2192 Hiring Manager Round:\r\nI had a panelist with around 10+ years of experience. Here, I was grilled on my resume projects and on every little keyword. He wanted to know why I used a particular approach and asked me to come up with a better approach, along with why I used a specific tech stack and whether it was feasible in a real-life scenario. Along with this, I was asked standard HR questions.\r\n\r\nResult: Rejected\r\n\r\nEven though I feel that I did pretty well in all my rounds, since they only took one candidate for my role in SDE, I think I was rejected due to my HM round performance.
