I\u2019m really happy with the offer overall, but my friend told me I should try to negotiate for more. I honestly almost never negotiate and usually just sign, should I negotiate or not, really hoping to get some advice here. If I negotiate, will I potentially lose this opportunity?\r\n\r\n\r\n## How I got the opportunity\r\nI got this opportunity through reach out from the Meta recruiter from email\r\n\r\n\r\n## Code signal OA\r\n\r\nAfter chatting with the recruiter, I got the OA link.\r\n\r\nThe gist of the question is to design a basic banking system with operations like creating accounts, depositing, transferring money, and keeping track of balances. \r\n\r\nThe time is super tight for this OA. At least for me. There are 3 levels, and each level is harder than before. You do need to be really careful with corner cases. I got stuck at level3 for some test cases at the end even though I've seen this exact OA question online before. I was really frustrated with myself for a bit but eventually able to figure it out and finished all the test cases. \r\n\r\n\r\n## How I prepared for Phone screen and onsite\r\nHonestly, I feel like I'm not the best at leetcoding. I worked for many years but didn't start doing leetcode until much later. I regret this when I started but glad it all worked out in the end.\r\n\r\nI mostly prepared the interview with Leetcode (practiced by tags) + offerretriever (OA and non-leetcode question) + ByteByteGo (system design)\r\n\r\n## Phone Screen\r\n2 leetcode problems in 45 mins\r\n\r\nI practiced all the high-frequency questions on leetcode but got two brand new never seen questions....My luck is just worst\r\n\r\nBarely finished the second question but somehow I passed\r\n\r\n## Onsite\r\n\r\nI split the onsite into two days. Honestly so nervous and stressed the whole time. I usually like to write down what I was asked right after the interview, but I didn't have time to write down too much details about the interviews during the onsite. I can try gather what I remembered into notes and share if anyone's interested\r\n\r\n## Team match timeline\r\n\r\nI started team matching around the end of last year. \r\nAt the first, my team match didn\u2019t make much progress, likely because of holidays. But I was finally able to match with a team recently. I feel like I could have chatted with more teams but the team matching was taking so long, I was honestly just ready for it to be over so I could feel more stable and less stressed.\r\n\r\n## Should I negotiate \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve seen posts on LeetCode and Blind where people share their Meta E5 comp and sometimes discuss negotiation strategies, but I've never done it. Should I try to push and ask for a bit more RSU or other components, or is it better to just accept what I have now?\r\n\r\nAny advice or data points from others who negotiated offers in the past would be really appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "vote_count": 5, "comment_count": 5, "view_count": 865, "creation_date": "2026-02-19 07:34:23"}

Expect questions on ML fundamentals (SVM, bias-variance, CV), model evaluation, data handling, DL/transformer basics, and high-level MLOps concepts. Python and pandas questions are small but tricky, so focus on why and when, not memorization.\r\n### Online Assessment 2\r\nThe second online test is a hands-on Agentic AI task focused on building an intelligent system using LLMs. It tests problem structuring, query routing, RAG concepts, tool orchestration, and handling real-time or structured data under constraints. The focus is on system design, clarity of logic, and producing reliable, structured outputs rather than model training.\r\n### Technical round - 1\r\n1. The first interview was highly technical and concept-driven, focusing on ML fundamentals, system thinking, and clarity of explanation. \r\n2. Questions covered ML concepts like supervised vs unsupervised learning, optimizers and gradient descent, transformers, BM25 keyword matching, and data vs model drift. \r\n3. There was strong emphasis on explaining projects clearly, including simplifying complex work so even a non-technical audience could understand it. \r\n4. Internship experience was discussed deeply, especially Spark architecture, pipeline migration, validation challenges, and why shuffles are costly. \r\n5. Overall, the round tested depth, reasoning, and the ability to connect technical work to real-world impact.\r\n### Technical round - 2 (Technical + Mangerial)\r\n1. The second round started with foundational technical questions before transitioning into behavioral discussion. \r\n2. The technical part focused on practical engineering fundamentals such as Kubernetes, Docker, Linux basics, Git and version control, documentation practices, cloud concepts, databases, AI agents, and deployment workflows. \r\n3. The intent was not deep tool-specific expertise, but understanding how these components fit together in real systems and how engineers reason about reliability and deployment. \r\n4. The latter half of the round was managerial and behavioral, assessing how I handle ambiguity, prioritize under constraints, collaborate across teams, document decisions, and learn unfamiliar technologies quickly. \r\n5. Overall, the round evaluated system-level thinking, ownership, calm problem-solving, and alignment with building reliable, production-ready solutions rather than isolated technical depth.\r\n\r\n### All the very best!!

{"id": 7548356, "title": "Uber | System Design Round | L5 | Design Kafka", "content": "Recently went through a system design round at Uber where the prompt was: \"Design a distributed message broker similar to Apache Kafka.\" The requirements focused on topic-based pub/sub, partitioned ordered storage, durability, consumer groups with parallel consumption, and at-least-once delivery. I thought the discussion went really well\u2014covered a ton of depth, including real Kafka internals and evolutions\u2014but ended up with some frustrating feedback.\n\n1. Requirements Clarification\nFunctional: Topics, publish/subscribe, ordered messages per partition, consumer groups for parallel processing, at-least-once guarantees via consumer acks.\nNon-functional: High throughput/low latency, durability (persistence to disk), scalability, fault tolerance.\nProbed on push vs. pull model \u2192 settled on pull-based (consumer polls) for better consumer pacing and backpressure handling.\n\n2. High-Level Architecture\nCore Components:\nBrokers clustered for scalability.\nTopics \u2192 Partitions \u2192 Replicas (primary + secondaries for fault tolerance).\nProducers publish to topics (key-based partitioning for ordering).\nConsumers in groups, with one-to-many consumer-to-partition mapping for parallelism.\nCoordination: Initially Zookeeper for metadata, leader election, and consumer offsets\u2014but explicitly discussed evolution to KRaft (quorum-based controller, no external dependency) as a more modern, ops-friendly direction.\nOptional Frontend Layer: Introduced a lightweight proxy layer for \"dumb\" clients (handles routing, auth, rate-limiting). Smart clients bypass it and talk directly to brokers after fetching metadata.\n\n3. Deep Dives & Trade-offs\nThis is where I went deep:\nStorage & Durability:\nWrite-ahead log style: Messages appended to partition segments on disk.\nPage cache leverage for fast reads.\nIn-sync replicas (ISR) concept: Leader waits for ack from ISR before committing.\nReplication & Failure Handling:\nPrimary host per partition, secondaries for redundancy.\nMix of sync (for durability) and async (for latency) replication.\nLeader election via ZAB (Zookeeper Atomic Broadcast) for strong consistency and quorum handling during network partitions or broker failures.\nProducer Side:\nSerialized operations at partition level for ordering.\nKey-based partitioning.\nConsumer Side:\nPoll + explicit ack for at-least-once guarantees.\nOffset tracking per consumer group/partition.\nParallel consumption within groups.\nRebalancing & Assignment:\nPartition assignment: Round-robin or resource-aware, ensuring replicas not co-located.\nCoordination: Used a flag (e.g., in Redis or metadata store) to pause consumers during rebalance\u2014simple and safe to avoid message loss/duplication. Discussed how this evolves toward Zookeeper based rebalancing in mature systems.\nScalability Topics:\nAdding/removing brokers: Reassign partitions via controller.\n\n\n4. Other Advanced Points\nExplicitly highlighted Kafka's real evolution: From heavy Zookeeper dependency \u2192 KRaft for self-managed quorum\n\n\n**Overall, I felt that the interview went quite well and was expecting Hire at least from the round. Considering other rounds were also postivie only I felt that I had more than 50% chance of being selected. However, to my horror I was told that I might only be eligible for L4 as there were callouts in relation to not asking enough calrifying questions. Since LLD, DSA and Managerial rounds went well and this problem itself was not very vague I can't seem to figure out what went wrong. My guess is that there are too many candidates so they end up finding weird reasons to reject candidates. To top it all, they rescheduled my interviews like 5-6 times and I had to keep on brushing up my concepts**\n\n![Screenshot 2026-01-23 at 3.33.29\u202fPM.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/d1917ecb-7e88-4c2d-a5e0-40f80cc792d2_1770114702.9370987.png)\n\n\n\n", "vote_count": 15, "comment_count": 8, "view_count": 2575, "creation_date": "2026-02-03 10:33:42"}
