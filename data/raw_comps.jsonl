Following the email screening the interviews started. I did sign an NDA so I will keep the information limited.\n\n## Interviews\n\n### Technical Screening\nFor one hour I met with a SWE on the team, half of the interview was behavioral and the other half of the interview was techical, two easy DSA questions were asked, no IDE was used, just had to explain the solution.\n\nThe day after the recruiter reached back out to let me know I would be advancing forward and another person would reach out. The next day the scheduler scheduled the interviews about 3 weeks later. Two one day and the other two the following day.\n\n### Loop\nRound 1: 2 DSA questions on HackerRank Interview where the code had to complile.\n\nRound 2: Personality + LLD \n\nRound 3: Personality + 1 DSA\n\nRound 4: Personality + 1 DSA\n\n## Verdict\nThe following day after the final interview the hiring manager called me to inform me they would be extending an offer. The recruiter reached out and explained the full process.\n\nY1 TC: ~240k\n", "vote_count": 10, "comment_count": 9, "view_count": 2446, "creation_date": "2025-07-22 00:30:47"}
