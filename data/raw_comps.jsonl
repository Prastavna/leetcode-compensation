{"id": 7146872, "title": "Google University Grad 2026 | Interview experience| India", "content": "# Google Interview Experience | University Grad 2026\r\n\r\nThis document outlines my experience during a technical interview for the Google University Grad 2026 role, focusing on a problem involving a monotonic stack.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## The Problem: Trapping Rain Water with Fountains \r\n\r\nI was asked a question that was a variation of the classic \"Trapping Rain Water\" problem.\r\n\r\n### Problem Statement\r\n\r\nYou are given a 1D array of integers, `surface`, representing a height map. You are also given an array of indices, `fountains`, which are source points for water. Water flows from these fountains to the left and right, filling any areas lower than the fountain's height until it hits a \"wall\" (a point higher than or equal to the fountain) or the edge of the array. The goal is to determine the final water level across the surface.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n-   `surface = [1, 2, 3, 4]`\r\n-   `fountains = [1, 3]` (Fountains at index 1 (height 2) and index 3 (height 4))\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## My Approach & Performance\r\n\r\nHere is a breakdown of my performance during the interview, including timing and thought process.\r\n\r\n### Approach 1: Brute Force\r\n\r\n-   **Explanation (10 mins):** I first described the brute-force solution. For each fountain, simulate the water flow outwards (one pointer to the left, one to the right). Keep track of the maximum water level at each position.\r\n-   **Complexity:**\r\n    -   Time: `O(N * K)` where N is the number of points and K is the number of fountains.\r\n    -   Space: `O(N)` to store the water levels.\r\n-   **Coding (5 mins):** I successfully coded this solution quickly.\r\n\r\n### Approach 2: Optimal (Monotonic Stack)\r\n\r\n-   **Explanation (10 mins for initial dry run):** I identified that the problem could be optimized by pre-calculating the \"next greater element\" to the left and right for each point. This is a classic use case for a **monotonic stack**. My initial attempt to dry-run this approach was shaky and took a significant amount of time.\r\n-   **Reset & Re-explanation (2-3 mins):** I took a moment to reset, then successfully explained the logic more clearly.\r\n-   **Coding (5 mins):** I started coding the optimal logic but ran out of time. I was only able to get about halfway through the implementation.\r\nLike, I coded the logic but did not return the array.\r\n-   **Complexity:**\r\n    -   Time: `O(N)` because the monotonic stack approach processes each element a constant number of times.\r\n    -   Space: `O(N)` for the stack.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Takeaways & Advice for Round 2\r\n\r\nSo, do any of you have feedback for me for Round 2?\r\nAnd what are key things I should improve?\r\n\r\nIs it **hire**/**lean hire**/**strong hire**?

Discussed the impact and use cases of AI for a SWE at Microsoft.\n\n[Self Verdict: Strong Hire]\n\n**Round 4: AA | Hiring Manager** (Behavioural+System Design) (60 minutes)\n\nInterviewer started with asking some behavioural questions regarding why thinking of job change and why Microsoft.

Wrote structured classes, functions and data structures for players, position, board, and gameplay. Discussed some optimizations of time and space and implemented them. Interviewer pointed out some edge cases and made required edits.\n\nHad some time leftover and interviewer was in Copilot team so got a chance to discuss the latest developments of AI and LLM happening inside Microsoft and what might be coming next.\n\n[Self Verdict: Strong Hire]\n\n---\n\n**Final Verdict** \ud83c\udf89\n\nGot verbal offer and document submission mail within 3 working days.

I have 3.3 YOE, CCTC 13 fixed, and holding an offer from a PBC of 22 LPA (17.5 fixed + bonus + RSU/year). However based on my skill set and experience, I feel its a lowballed offer.\r\n\r\nI have asked for 23LPA fixed and Developer role (T2.1) to which she both denied, and said she needs to check with the hiring manager and will get back on how much they can offer maximum. My interview feedbacks were very strong and I personally feel bit overqualified for T1.3.\r\n\r\nCan anyone please let me know how much can I fairly expect? I read somewhere that SAP employees have an internal tool where they can see the salary band for each grade. It would be great if any employee from SAP Labs can share the salary range for T1.3/T2.1\u00a0band\u00a0and any tips on how to push for T2.1.
