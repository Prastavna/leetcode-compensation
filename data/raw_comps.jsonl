Previous interview experiences were really key in cracking these rounds. Hence doing my bit by sharing my experience. \n\nI have a total of 3 yrs of experience of working at quick commerce startups (swiggy and zepto)\n\nFirst round: DM\u2019ed a recruiter looking for openings, soon within 3 days she shared a hacker rank link. This contained 2 DSA questions (both medium). First question was a binary search based and another on trees. Post that there were some LP based questions (choice based questions).\n\nIt took my recruiter almost 2 weeks to get back and another 10 days to schedule an interview. \n\nSecond Round: This was a System design round, the objective was to design an auction platform. Interviewer focussed primarily on DB schemas, scaling and designing low latency apis (caching). No LP was asked instead the interviewer asked to explain any interesting project from my past work.\n\nFollow ups: \n1. How do you handle edits to bids ( I suggesting allowing multiple bids rather than providing an edit option.) \n2. How would you support a near real-time leaderboard (redis sorted sets)\n3. How would you identify/track the winning bid (can\u2019t rely on redis as source of truth)\n\nI relied on hello interview for my prep, although I hadn\u2019t previously solved this question I was able to come up with an acceptable solution in time.\n\nVerdict: Passed, got good feedback from the interviewer.\n\nThird round: LLD discussion with Hiring manager, although this was supposed to be a LLD round, the interviewer primarily focused on my work ex at zepto and my design choices from my projects. We also discussed if we could build an inventory service using NoSQL (zepto uses SQL). Last 10 mins were focused on explaining what design pattern was used in some of my old projects. No LPs asked in this round.\n\nVerdict: Got positive feedback. I was worried cuz interviewer never asked any LLD question.\n\nRound 3: DSA round, a younger SDE-2 was the interviewer. First question - Implement an interface to navigate browser history. \nSecond question - Implement basic arithmetic operations  like +,-,*,/ without using any inbuilt functions.\n\nI used golang to write the code, and was able to implement both of these in time. Although the interviewer wasn\u2019t aware of this language and I had to explain the basics to him. Also I felt the interviewer was neither interested in understanding a diff language nor was able to ask follow ups properly \n\nVerdict: Positive but slightly hesitant.\n\nBar raiser: Was asked questions based on LPs related to ownership. 2 DSA questions, 1) rotten oranges (graph BFS) 2) Asteriod collisions (Stack)\n\nHeard back from the recruiter in two days, got an offer.\n\nOffer - 46L base, 29L joining bonus (over 2 years) and 38L esops\n", "vote_count": 65, "comment_count": 13, "view_count": 5141, "creation_date": "2026-01-08 10:47:14"}

There were 2 questions at the level of easy-medium.\n\nFun part comes here as I had almost forgotten that I have given OA as they reached out to me at the end of October for scheduling the interview loop. Leetcode Discuss section helped me understand the interview pattern and prepare for it in short time.\n\nThe interview happened as a drive with many candidates joining in a zoom call and sent to different rooms. There were 3 rounds which can happen in any order.\n\n### R1: System Design - HLD\nThey have hackerrank whiteboard set up with structure for interview and asked me to design a Rate Limiter. I have not did this question before but with the understanding I had asked for Functional & Non-functional requirements and defined the APIs and Entities. Then went ahead with drawing a simple system with Load Balancer, Services and using DB to track requests. I had follow up questions on handling failures and DB being down. I had explained and communicated this can be scaled up to using API Gateway with Redis for a distributed system. Overall it went well and interviewer seemed happy.\n\nI later saw that there are various algos as well for implementing the request tracker. As I understand, it might depend on how we drive. It's good to be aware of the basic system asked & if we talk more, they ask more :)\n\n### R2: Behavioral : \nStandard resume and situational based questions. Be confident and relate answers to the questions asked and keep it crisp.\n\n### R3: Code review + DSA : \nBe thorough with Java Basics to highlight and suggest the fixes. One DSA question on the easy-medium, take time to understand and ask clarifying questions. Can solve easily if don't panic.\n\nI used Hello Interview to recap DSA and learn System Design\n\n\n# Compenstation Details:\n\nCurrent Company : MNC Bank\nCurrent CTC : 16 LPA\nLocation : Bangalore\nYOE : 3 years 4 months (when interviewed)\nEducation : B.Tech from NIT\n\nJPMC Offer\nLocation : Hyderabad\nPosition : SDE2 (Associate)\nFixed : 25 LPA (including PF)\nVariable : 0-12% (Not mentioned in Offer Letter)\nRelocation : Standard JPMC Relocation benefits\n\nAccpted the offer, couldn't negotiate much as HR said can't go for more and I didn't get any competing offers.", "vote_count": 2, "comment_count": 6, "view_count": 1724, "creation_date": "2026-01-01 13:46:36"}

[K most frequent elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)\r\n2. [Generate all subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/description/)\r\n\r\nWas able to solve both questions. Interviewer asked about time complexity and space complexity for each solution. Anwered it and then that was it for the round.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n# **Round 2:(Monday)**\r\nAgain two questions:\r\n1. [Rotten oranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/description/) variation.\r\n2. [k distance nodes in binary tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-nodes-distance-k-in-binary-tree/).\r\n\r\nWas able to solve the first question easily. For second question I knew the approach where we store the parent of each node in a map and then do a BFS from given node.\r\nHowever interviewer wanted me to come up with an approach without storing parent. \r\nIt took me some time to figure out the recursive approach as I had never solved this problem with recursive approach before. The interviewer asked about Time and space complexity of all these solutions. I answered it and he looked satisfied with the code and other answers and wrapped up.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n# **Round 3 (Bar raiser):(Next wednesday)**\r\n\r\nI was told by HR that only three LP questions would be asked. I prepared my stories for FAQs.  \r\nBut Interviewer gave me one DSA problem:\r\n1. Given the root of a tree, a source and a target. Find out the shortest path from source to target and print the path in given way:\r\n    'A' - If moving to left child\r\n    'B' - If moving to right child\r\n    'C' - If moving to parent\r\n\r\neg:\r\n 2\r\n/ \\\\\r\n1 4\r\nsrc: 1 target: 4\r\n\r\noutput: \"CB\"\r\n\r\nI came up with an approach to store the parent of each node and then do a BFS from src and keep track of path. Interviewer asked me to optimise the solution. Suggested me not to use any extra space.\r\nIt took me around 30 mins to reach to its solution. I proposed LCA approach where I would first find LCA of both nodes and then simple dfs would have worked with slight modification for path printing. \r\n\r\n2. After this, a couple of LP scenario based question were asked. Sounded more like formality. However I gave the answers which I had prepared. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# **Result:**\r\nI was not sure of the outcome as my third round did not look good to me. Even I had solved the problem but it took me multiple approaches and 30 mins to reach to the desired solution. \r\nThe result was declared exactly one week after the interview and I got the email saying **\"Congratulations you got the job\"**.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# **Compensation**\r\n\r\n**Current:**\r\ncompany: Fintech MNC\r\nbase: 13.4 lpa\r\njoining bonus: 3L\r\nRelocation: 1L\r\nperformance : 10-15% of base.\r\nYOE: 1 year 4 months\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Offered:**\r\nBase: 19,17,000 lpa\r\njoining bonus(year 1): 6,47,000\r\njoining bonus(year 2): 5,18,000\r\nRSUs: 15,56,000 (Vested in 4 years, 5%, 15%, 40%, 40%)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Thank you to the leetcode community**.
