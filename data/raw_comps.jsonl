Because of the laggy interface, most of the time went into handling the platform rather than optimizing the code.\n\n- There were also some MCQs, but I could attempt only a few due to time constraints.\n\n*\ud83e\udde0 Tip: Focus on easy to easy\u2013medium level DSA questions and get comfortable with JUnit test cases. Time management is key since the platform can be slow.*\n\n---\n\n\n**Round 2: Technical Interview**\n\n- This round mainly focused on Java 8 and advanced Java concepts.\n\n- The interviewer gave one coding problem and asked me to solve it strictly using Java 8 features (Streams, Lambdas, Optionals, etc.).\n\n- The problem itself was not hard, but they wanted to see how effectively I could apply modern Java concepts.\n\n- A few additional questions came from Multithreading and Spring Boot basics.\n\n*\ud83e\udde9 Tip: Revise Streams API, Functional Interfaces, Collectors, and core Spring Boot annotations. They focus more on your coding approach than just the final output.*\n\n---\n\n**Round 3: Techno-Managerial Interview (Approx. 1.5 Hours)**\n\n> This was the most detailed round of the entire process, and during this round, I got to know that the position was actually for Goldman Sachs as the client.\n\n**First Half (Technical):**\n\n- Deep dive into Spring Boot, Microservices, REST APIs, API Gateway, Deployment process, and CI/CD pipelines.\n\n- Questions were scenario-based and tested how I would approach real-world issues like service failures, scalability, and versioning.\n\n**Second Half (Managerial):**\n\n- Detailed discussion on my current project, roles and responsibilities, and features I delivered.\n\n- I was asked about story points assigned in the last sprint and how much I delivered on time.\n\n- The focus was on accountability, communication, and ownership of work.\n\n*\ud83e\udde0 Tip: Have a strong understanding of your project especially architecture, deployment flow, and your personal contributions.*\n\n---\n\n**Round 4: HR Discussion (Approx. 30 Minutes)**\n\n> This was a very calm and straightforward discussion.\n\n- Covered salary expectations, family background, and preferred work mode.\n\n- We also talked about benefits and allowances, make sure you ask clearly about:\n\n  - Joining bonus\n\n  - Relocation allowance\n\n  - Temporary stay/accommodation support\n\n*\ud83d\udca1 Tip: If you are expecting a 150%+ hike, prepare a clear justification for it, like your technical expertise, project ownership, or market standards.*\n\n---\n\n\n", "vote_count": 4, "comment_count": 1, "view_count": 652, "creation_date": "2025-10-08 17:02:41"}
