Because of the laggy interface, most of the time went into handling the platform rather than optimizing the code.\n\n- There were also some MCQs, but I could attempt only a few due to time constraints.\n\n*\ud83e\udde0 Tip: Focus on easy to easy\u2013medium level DSA questions and get comfortable with JUnit test cases. Time management is key since the platform can be slow.*\n\n---\n\n\n**Round 2: Technical Interview**\n\n- This round mainly focused on Java 8 and advanced Java concepts.\n\n- The interviewer gave one coding problem and asked me to solve it strictly using Java 8 features (Streams, Lambdas, Optionals, etc.).\n\n- The problem itself was not hard, but they wanted to see how effectively I could apply modern Java concepts.\n\n- A few additional questions came from Multithreading and Spring Boot basics.\n\n*\ud83e\udde9 Tip: Revise Streams API, Functional Interfaces, Collectors, and core Spring Boot annotations. They focus more on your coding approach than just the final output.*\n\n---\n\n**Round 3: Techno-Managerial Interview (Approx. 1.5 Hours)**\n\n> This was the most detailed round of the entire process, and during this round, I got to know that the position was actually for Goldman Sachs as the client.\n\n**First Half (Technical):**\n\n- Deep dive into Spring Boot, Microservices, REST APIs, API Gateway, Deployment process, and CI/CD pipelines.\n\n- Questions were scenario-based and tested how I would approach real-world issues like service failures, scalability, and versioning.\n\n**Second Half (Managerial):**\n\n- Detailed discussion on my current project, roles and responsibilities, and features I delivered.\n\n- I was asked about story points assigned in the last sprint and how much I delivered on time.\n\n- The focus was on accountability, communication, and ownership of work.\n\n*\ud83e\udde0 Tip: Have a strong understanding of your project especially architecture, deployment flow, and your personal contributions.*\n\n---\n\n**Round 4: HR Discussion (Approx. 30 Minutes)**\n\n> This was a very calm and straightforward discussion.\n\n- Covered salary expectations, family background, and preferred work mode.\n\n- We also talked about benefits and allowances, make sure you ask clearly about:\n\n  - Joining bonus\n\n  - Relocation allowance\n\n  - Temporary stay/accommodation support\n\n*\ud83d\udca1 Tip: If you are expecting a 150%+ hike, prepare a clear justification for it, like your technical expertise, project ownership, or market standards.*\n\n---\n\n\n", "vote_count": 4, "comment_count": 1, "view_count": 652, "creation_date": "2025-10-08 17:02:41"}

{"id": 7238436, "title": "The Stable Marriage Problem | Review Problem | Gale-Shapley Algorithm", "content": "You are given n men and n women. Each man has a ranked preference list of all n women, and each woman has a ranked preference list of all n men. The goal is to find a stable matching, which is a pairing of all n men and n women such that no two people would prefer to be with each other over their current partners.\r\n\r\nA pair (m,w) is considered unstable if:\r\n\r\nm prefers some other woman w\u2032 over his current partner w.\r\n\r\nw\u2032 also prefers m over her current partner.\r\n\r\nYour task is to implement an algorithm that finds a stable matching for any given set of preferences.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nLet n=2.\r\nMen: M_1,M_2\r\nWomen: W_1,W_2\r\n\r\nPreferences:\r\n\r\nM_1: W_1, W_2\r\n\r\nM_2: W_2, W_1\r\n\r\nW_1: M_2, M_1\r\n\r\nW_2: M_1, M_2\r\n\r\nInput:\r\n\r\nmen_preferences = {\r\n    \"M1\": [\"W1\", \"W2\"],\r\n    \"M2\": [\"W2\", \"W1\"]\r\n}\r\nwomen_preferences = {\r\n    \"W1\": [\"M2\", \"M1\"],\r\n    \"W2\": [\"M1\", \"M2\"]\r\n}\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n[(\"M1\", \"W2\"), (\"M2\", \"W1\")]\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nM_1 is paired with W_2. Even though he prefers W_1, W_1 prefers her partner M_2 over M_1, so no instability exists.\r\n\r\nM_2 is paired with W_1. He prefers her to his other option, and she prefers him to her other option. This is a stable pair.\r\n\r\nConstraints:\r\n\r\n1\u2264n\u226450\r\n\r\nAll preference lists are complete and unique.\r\n\r\nGeneral Solution for n x n: The Gale-Shapley Algorithm\r\nThe most common and effective solution for the stable marriage problem is the Gale-Shapley algorithm. It guarantees a stable matching in polynomial time (O(n2)).\r\n\r\nAlgorithm Steps:\r\nInitialization: All men and women are considered free.\r\n\r\nProposals: The algorithm proceeds in rounds. In each round, every free man proposes to the most-preferred woman on his list to whom he has not yet proposed.\r\n\r\nResponses:\r\n\r\nIf a woman receives a proposal from a man she is currently free, she accepts and becomes engaged to him.\r\n\r\nIf a woman is already engaged but receives a proposal from a man she prefers over her current fianc\u00e9, she accepts the new proposal and jilts her current fianc\u00e9. The jilted man becomes free again.\r\n\r\nIf a woman receives a proposal from a man she considers less desirable than her current fianc\u00e9, she rejects his proposal.\r\n\r\nTermination: This process continues until every man is engaged. The algorithm is guaranteed to terminate because in each step, at least one man proposes to a woman he has not yet proposed to, and no man ever proposes to the same woman twice. The final set of engaged pairs is a stable matching.\r\n\r\nWhy it Works:\r\nThe algorithm is \"male-optimal\" because it guarantees that every man gets the best possible partner he could get in any stable matching. This is because men propose in order of preference. If a man gets rejected by a woman, he knows it's because she found someone she prefers more, and he can't do better than his final partner. The reverse is true for women, making the algorithm \"female-pessimal.\" However, a stable matching is always found.\r\n\r\nExample: 3x3 Case with More Input/Output\r\nLet's consider n=3.\r\nMen: M_1,M_2,M_3\r\nWomen: W_1,W_2,W_3\r\n\r\nPreferences:\r\n\r\nM_1: W_1,W_2,W_3\r\n\r\nM_2: W_2,W_1,W_3\r\n\r\nM_3: W_1,W_2,W_3\r\n\r\nW_1: M_2,M_1,M_3\r\n\r\nW_2: M_1,M_2,M_3\r\n\r\nW_3: M_1,M_2,M_3\r\n\r\nStep-by-step execution:\r\n\r\nRound 1:\r\n\r\nM_1 proposes to W_1. W_1 is free, so she accepts. Pair: (M_1,W_1).\r\n\r\nM_2 proposes to W_2. W_2 is free, so she accepts. Pair: (M_2,W_2).\r\n\r\nM_3 proposes to W_1. W_1 is already engaged to M_1. She checks her list: she prefers M_2M_1M_3. She rejects M_3.\r\n\r\nRound 2:\r\n\r\nM_3 is the only free man. He proposes to his next choice, W_2.\r\n\r\nW_2 is engaged to M_2. She checks her list: she prefers M_1M_2M_3. She rejects M_3.\r\n\r\nRound 3:\r\n\r\nM_3 is still free. He proposes to his next choice, W_3.\r\n\r\nW_3 is free. She accepts. Pair: (M_3,W_3).\r\n\r\nAll men are now engaged. The algorithm terminates.\r\n\r\nFinal Output:\r\nThe stable matching is: [(\"M1\", \"W1\"), (\"M2\", \"W2\"), (\"M3\", \"W3\")]\r\n\r\nCode C++ \r\n\r\n#include <iostream>\r\n#include <vector>\r\n#include <string>\r\n#include <map>\r\n#include <list>\r\n\r\n// Function to find a stable matching using the Gale-Shapley algorithm\r\nstd::map<std::string, std::string> stableMatching(\r\n    const std::map<std::string, std::list<std::string>>& men_preferences,\r\n    const std::map<std::string, std::list<std::string>>& women_preferences) {\r\n\r\n    int n = men_preferences.size();\r\n    \r\n    // Tracks men who are currently free\r\n    std::list<std::string> free_men;\r\n    for (const auto& pair : men_preferences) {\r\n        free_men.push_back(pair.first);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    // Tracks current engagements (woman -> man)\r\n    std::map<std::string, std::string> engagements;\r\n    \r\n    // A mapping from a woman's name to a map of men and their ranks.\r\n    // This allows for O(1) lookup of a man's rank on a woman's preference list.\r\n    std::map<std::string, std::map<std::string, int>> women_ranks;\r\n    for (const auto& pair : women_preferences) {\r\n        int rank = 0;\r\n        for (const auto& man : pair.second) {\r\n            women_ranks[pair.first][man] = rank++;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    while (!free_men.empty()) {\r\n        std::string man = free_men.front();\r\n        free_men.pop_front();\r\n\r\n        // Get the first woman on his preference list he hasn't proposed to yet\r\n        std::string woman = men_preferences.at(man).front();\r\n\r\n        // Remove the proposed woman from the man's preference list\r\n        const_cast<std::map<std::string, std::list<std::string>>&>(men_preferences).at(man).pop_front();\r\n\r\n        // If the woman is free, she accepts the proposal\r\n        if (engagements.find(woman) == engagements.end()) {\r\n            engagements[woman] = man;\r\n        } else {\r\n            // Woman is already engaged.
