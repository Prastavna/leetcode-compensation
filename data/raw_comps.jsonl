{"id": 7146872, "title": "Google University Grad 2026 | Interview experience| India", "content": "# Google Interview Experience | University Grad 2026\r\n\r\nThis document outlines my experience during a technical interview for the Google University Grad 2026 role, focusing on a problem involving a monotonic stack.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## The Problem: Trapping Rain Water with Fountains \r\n\r\nI was asked a question that was a variation of the classic \"Trapping Rain Water\" problem.\r\n\r\n### Problem Statement\r\n\r\nYou are given a 1D array of integers, `surface`, representing a height map. You are also given an array of indices, `fountains`, which are source points for water. Water flows from these fountains to the left and right, filling any areas lower than the fountain's height until it hits a \"wall\" (a point higher than or equal to the fountain) or the edge of the array. The goal is to determine the final water level across the surface.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n-   `surface = [1, 2, 3, 4]`\r\n-   `fountains = [1, 3]` (Fountains at index 1 (height 2) and index 3 (height 4))\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## My Approach & Performance\r\n\r\nHere is a breakdown of my performance during the interview, including timing and thought process.\r\n\r\n### Approach 1: Brute Force\r\n\r\n-   **Explanation (10 mins):** I first described the brute-force solution. For each fountain, simulate the water flow outwards (one pointer to the left, one to the right). Keep track of the maximum water level at each position.\r\n-   **Complexity:**\r\n    -   Time: `O(N * K)` where N is the number of points and K is the number of fountains.\r\n    -   Space: `O(N)` to store the water levels.\r\n-   **Coding (5 mins):** I successfully coded this solution quickly.\r\n\r\n### Approach 2: Optimal (Monotonic Stack)\r\n\r\n-   **Explanation (10 mins for initial dry run):** I identified that the problem could be optimized by pre-calculating the \"next greater element\" to the left and right for each point. This is a classic use case for a **monotonic stack**. My initial attempt to dry-run this approach was shaky and took a significant amount of time.\r\n-   **Reset & Re-explanation (2-3 mins):** I took a moment to reset, then successfully explained the logic more clearly.\r\n-   **Coding (5 mins):** I started coding the optimal logic but ran out of time. I was only able to get about halfway through the implementation.\r\nLike, I coded the logic but did not return the array.\r\n-   **Complexity:**\r\n    -   Time: `O(N)` because the monotonic stack approach processes each element a constant number of times.\r\n    -   Space: `O(N)` for the stack.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Takeaways & Advice for Round 2\r\n\r\nSo, do any of you have feedback for me for Round 2?\r\nAnd what are key things I should improve?\r\n\r\nIs it **hire**/**lean hire**/**strong hire**?
