I was serving notice period at the Investment Bank, and was about to join the Core Bank.\r\n\r\n**Round 1**\r\nThere were 2 hard but standard questions on graphs.\r\n\r\n[Alien Dictionary](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/)\r\n[Word Ladder II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder-ii/description/)\r\n\r\nIt went smooth, interviewer was friendly. Got a call from the recruiter to schedule next round the next day.\r\n\r\n**Round 2**\r\nIt was a problem solving and debugging round. I had to clone an open source database driver codebase from GitHub. Then, the interviewer asked me to explain where different features are implemented in the code - the code block or the line. He started with specific database configurations like pools, connection logic.\r\n\r\nThen I had to clone the database codebase itself. The interviewer asked where indexing is implemented. Then I had to show where the actual execution logic was implemented. \r\n\r\nI was appearing for such type of round for the first time. I had prior open-source experience, so that helped.\r\n\r\nFew days later, I got a call from the recruiter that they have chosen someone internally.\r\n\r\n(I got another call after 2 weeks that there is one more opening, and I was the foremost in interview queue so they wanted to schedule next rounds. But I had joined the core bank by then. Still I appeared for the interview.)\r\n\r\n**Round 3**\r\nIt was an HLD round. The interviewer was friendly and asked to design a Chat Application. I presented my approach, we discussed on the tradeoffs and it went well.\r\n\r\nGot a call the same day to schedule next round.\r\n\r\n**Round 4**\r\nIt was HM round. He asked some technical questions around Kafka and messaging systems. Then there was some discussion around the job role and day-to-day activities. We discussed on my open source experience, and my interests in core technologies. It was perhaps my favourite round.\r\n\r\nGot final result after a few days.\r\n\r\nResult - **Selected**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "vote_count": 18, "comment_count": 6, "view_count": 1800, "creation_date": "2025-12-21 18:12:14"}

[K most frequent elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)\r\n2. [Generate all subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/description/)\r\n\r\nWas able to solve both questions. Interviewer asked about time complexity and space complexity for each solution. Anwered it and then that was it for the round.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n# **Round 2:(Monday)**\r\nAgain two questions:\r\n1. [Rotten oranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/description/) variation.\r\n2. [k distance nodes in binary tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-nodes-distance-k-in-binary-tree/).\r\n\r\nWas able to solve the first question easily. For second question I knew the approach where we store the parent of each node in a map and then do a BFS from given node.\r\nHowever interviewer wanted me to come up with an approach without storing parent. \r\nIt took me some time to figure out the recursive approach as I had never solved this problem with recursive approach before. The interviewer asked about Time and space complexity of all these solutions. I answered it and he looked satisfied with the code and other answers and wrapped up.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n# **Round 3 (Bar raiser):(Next wednesday)**\r\n\r\nI was told by HR that only three LP questions would be asked. I prepared my stories for FAQs.  \r\nBut Interviewer gave me one DSA problem:\r\n1. Given the root of a tree, a source and a target. Find out the shortest path from source to target and print the path in given way:\r\n    'A' - If moving to left child\r\n    'B' - If moving to right child\r\n    'C' - If moving to parent\r\n\r\neg:\r\n 2\r\n/ \\\\\r\n1 4\r\nsrc: 1 target: 4\r\n\r\noutput: \"CB\"\r\n\r\nI came up with an approach to store the parent of each node and then do a BFS from src and keep track of path. Interviewer asked me to optimise the solution. Suggested me not to use any extra space.\r\nIt took me around 30 mins to reach to its solution. I proposed LCA approach where I would first find LCA of both nodes and then simple dfs would have worked with slight modification for path printing. \r\n\r\n2. After this, a couple of LP scenario based question were asked. Sounded more like formality. However I gave the answers which I had prepared. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# **Result:**\r\nI was not sure of the outcome as my third round did not look good to me. Even I had solved the problem but it took me multiple approaches and 30 mins to reach to the desired solution. \r\nThe result was declared exactly one week after the interview and I got the email saying **\"Congratulations you got the job\"**.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# **Compensation**\r\n\r\n**Current:**\r\ncompany: Fintech MNC\r\nbase: 13.4 lpa\r\njoining bonus: 3L\r\nRelocation: 1L\r\nperformance : 10-15% of base.\r\nYOE: 1 year 4 months\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Offered:**\r\nBase: 19,17,000 lpa\r\njoining bonus(year 1): 6,47,000\r\njoining bonus(year 2): 5,18,000\r\nRSUs: 15,56,000 (Vested in 4 years, 5%, 15%, 40%, 40%)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Thank you to the leetcode community**.

Connected components of graph\r\n2. Bit Manipulation \r\n3. DP problem\r\n### Online Assessment 2\r\nThis was unique round compared to that of typical coding rounds, had one coding question and then system design round for 45 min.\r\n1. Dynamic Programming question - weighted job scheduling which is classic DP problem with Binary Search.\r\n2. System Design round -\r\nTo give you context I was asked to design the backend system for a threading feature inside a chat app like Slack or Microsoft Teams that lets users reply directly to a specific message in a channel without cluttering the main chat feed.\r\nBased on this problem statements 3 questions were asked which include designing non-functional features, Data model and relationships and then APIs and it's core functionality. These more or less covers the entire system design part.\r\n### Technical round\r\n1. This round was entirely based on the Online Assessment 2 round held for 70-80 min roughly.\r\nFirstly, on the DSA question which was asked they start by asking why did you choose this approach, is there any other alternative and how did you draw to a conclusion that only this works.\r\nIn short, you need to present your thinking ability and insights and present with some of test cases.\r\nAlso, share your thoughts about the Edge cases. \r\n2. On system design part, first I was asked to explain about the flow of building this feature and then questions on non-functional design features and their importance. Also I was asked to draw the ER model of the entire data bases which are gonna be used in building this feature. Asked to optimize the some of key features in the implementation part as well and was asked to write the code for API calls.\r\n\r\n##### I was rejected after this round.\r\n##### My learnings (what I feel went wrong) -\r\n1. Coming to DSA, it went good I explained my approach from bruteforce to optimization using DP very well.\r\n2. System Design is what I feel lacked, Asked about methods for durability of the data bases I explained about replicas, Write-Ahead logs and Backups but asked on more alternatives I stuck there. And also while designing ER model I feel that I was bit under-confident, and was asked to write API calls, I called two attributes where it can be done with calling one itself.\r\nThese are the parts where I missed and answered remaining all of them but learnings are always know all the alternative methods as well and be confident on what you're designing along with valid explanations.\r\n\r\nThough I didn't make it but I had idea of next rounds.\r\n\r\n### Mangerial Round\r\nComplete resume grill and can expect any type of questions. Be prepared!\r\n\r\n### HR round\r\nHR questions and assessing your work style and culture fit.\r\n\r\nAll the very best!! Let's crack it.

{"id": 7330779, "title": "Morgan Stanley | Associate | Offer", "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI recently cracked Morgan Stanley with a package of around 28 LPA. I\u2019m currently working in the payments domain, and my strengths are in DSA, core SDE concepts, and System Design. From what I\u2019ve heard, the work-life balance and culture there are pretty good, especially compared to FAANG or other fintech companies.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m wondering if I should be satisfied with this offer or apply to other companies for a potentially higher package. My main goal is to have a stable and balanced career without compromising on technical growth.\n\nWould love to hear thoughts from folks working at Morgan Stanley or other product-based companies, or keep pushing for bigger offers while the market is still good?\n", "vote_count": 0, "comment_count": 3, "view_count": 1337, "creation_date": "2025-11-06 13:53:24"}
